# Cursor Rules for SupaHealth Server

## Project Structure
This is a FastAPI backend server for a health application. The main application code is in the `app/` directory.

## Key Directories
- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy database models
- `app/schemas/` - Pydantic data schemas
- `app/services/` - Business logic services
- `app/db/` - Database configuration and session management

## Important Files
- `app/main.py` - Main FastAPI application entry point
- `pyproject.toml` - Project dependencies and configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Development environment setup

## Cursor Behavior
- DO NOT suggest creating README files in subdirectories
- Focus on code implementation, not documentation
- The main README.md at the root is sufficient
- Prioritize code quality and functionality over documentation

## Code Style
- Use FastAPI best practices
- Follow Python type hints
- Use async/await for database operations
- Implement proper error handling with HTTPException
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations

## Database
- PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Alembic for migrations
- Models in `app/models/models.py`
- Database session management in `app/db/session.py`
